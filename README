What it does
------------

It replaces a given select element with an easily stylable dropdown. Usage:

  $('#your-select-id').dropSelect();

Yes, that's it, for now.

TODO
----

o Provide 3 built in styles: top/bottom/centered (currently only bottom style is available, which means the dropdown slides down)
o Provide callbacks so you can add your own animations to the menu
o Publish on jQuery plugins page
